{"name":"Pretty Test","body":"# Pretty Test\r\n\r\n`pretty_test` is a Ruby gem that will make output from your\r\n[minitest](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/minitest/unit/rdoc/index.html)\r\ntests pretty and useful.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\n\r\nThere are only two things I want to see *while* running a suite of tests: progress and failed tests.\r\n\r\n[minitest](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/minitest/unit/rdoc/index.html)\r\nprints dots for passed tests and Fs for failed tests - not very useful. If you want to know *which* tests failed and *why*, you have to wait until the whole suite is finished. This kind of feedback is painfully slow.\r\n\r\n[Turn](https://github.com/TwP/turn) with the default settings brings a huge improvement by printing failed test details immediately. But it also prints one line for every passed test. So you'll often get just a glimpse of a failed test stack trace immediately replaced by a fast-scrolling list of passed tests. *(I know there are other output formats in turn but I haven't found any of them very useful.)*\r\n\r\n## The solution\r\n\r\nWith `pretty_test` you'll get\r\n\r\n* number of passed and failed tests, number of passed assertions,\r\n* name of currently running test,\r\n* error information and a colorised stack trace for every failed test,\r\n* highlighted line of code that most likely caused the failure.\r\n\r\nAnd all of this in real time.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to add `pretty_test` to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    group :test do\r\n      gem \"pretty_test\"\r\n      # ...\r\n    end\r\n\r\nand enjoy pretty and useful test output.\r\n","tagline":"Beautiful output for minitest","google":"UA-1584061-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
